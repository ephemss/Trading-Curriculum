# Trading Curriculum

Trading is this weird sport where everyone plays it, yet there aren't really any standard curriculums, and there are tons of scammers who charge subscriptions to Discord groups or emailing lists, claiming to net you that few hundred dollars profit.

Who can we trust? How do we know what works? We don't, but in general, we trust ourselves to a large degree. Therefore, I've curated a curriculum of sorts where you can self-learn and combine what you see in the real world through readings, Twitter, etc., with your own trading experience and thoughts.

The goal here is to give you an objective foundation for knowledge in the trading world, sort of like taking an undergraduate major in trading.

As always, books will have their goods and bads, outdated quips and legendary quotes. It's up to you to choose how you read these books and pick out what you think is useful or not for your trading needs.

## Introductory

Before we start trading, we should have a primer about what it's like to be in the business. We want to learn some psychology here, some foundational skills, and just get an idea of what distinguishes good and bad traders.

- [_Most Important Thing_ by Howard Marks](https://amzn.to/3GXdQMm): Some good mindset things to remember
- [_One Up on Wall Street_ by Peter Lynch](https://amzn.to/3Fcxx2v): The idea of "boomer" investing and fundamentals. Really encourages you to do your DD (due diligence).
- [_The Theory of Poker_ by David Sklansky](https://amzn.to/3p90t5V): Poker is probably the best game to quickly learn about how EV (expected value) works and how to manage risk.
- [_The Signal and the Noise_ by Nate Silver](https://amzn.to/30KTreg): There is a lot of data in the world, but what is useful and what is not?
- [_Superforecasting_ by Phillip E. Tetlock](https://amzn.to/3yFmsUZ): Why are some people better at predicting the future than others?
